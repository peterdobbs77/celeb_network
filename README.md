I want to try out network diagramming and other tools. I'm curious about the numerous celebrities involved in different long-running TV franchises, like Baywatch, Law & Order, CSI, Stargate, 9-1-1, and more!

There's a variety of roles that actors can have in these franchises. From leading roles to extra work, I want to visualize these careers and find the oddities along the way.
